# Stock Candle Wick Analyzer

This is a minimal script to create stock price candle screenshots that 1)loads them to imagekit.io and 2)analyzes the images using LLM vision models, in this instance OpenAI's GPT-4o.

Check back later for optimized scripts, since this project is still in the debugging phase 🚧👷‍♂️🏗️

Currently in the task pipeline:  

- Successfully upload image to imagekit.io and analyze with LLM. :white_check_mark:
- Generate sample output text files. :construction: 🏗️
