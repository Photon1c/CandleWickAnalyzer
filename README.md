# Stock Candle Wick Analyzers

This is a collection of minimal scripts which aim to create stock price candle screenshots that 1)are uploaded to imagekit.io and 2)Using LLM vision models, analyze the uploaded images-- in this instance using OpenAI's GPT-4o. The fatman script uses LLM chat completion, while the imagekit test is running into write permission issues that will be updated as time permits.

Check back later for optimized scripts, since this project is still in the debugging phase :construction: :building_construction: :construction_worker:

Currently in the task pipeline:  

- Successfully upload image to imagekit.io and analyze with LLM. :white_check_mark:
- Generate sample output text files. :construction: :building_construction:
