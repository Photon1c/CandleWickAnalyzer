This is a minimal script to create stock price candle screenshots to 1)load them to imagekit.io and 2)analyze the images using LLM vision models, in this instance OpenAI GPT-4o.

Check back later for the working script as this project is still in the debugging phase!

Currently in the task pipeline:  

- Successfully upload image to imagekit.io and analyze with LLM. :white_check_mark:
