    AI-Generated Insights:
    Price Volatility: With the average total size of each candlestick at 3.87, this indicates a relatively high degree of price volatility. This shows that prices have been moving up and down quite significantly within a given time frame. 

Trends in Upper and Lower Wicks: The average size of the upper wick (1.06) is slightly smaller than the average size of the lower wick (1.17). This suggests that during the period, sellers have been pushing the price down from its peak during the trading period more than buyers have been able to push the price up from its low. However, the lack of a significant difference suggests that there's considerable tug-of-war between buyers and sellers.

Wick Score Indications: The average wick score of 2.23 indicates a considerable amount of fluctuation between the highs and lows of the stock price within the trading period. A high wick score typically indicates a market with active trading and drastic price shifts within a trading period.

Based on these observations, the market sentiment for the upcoming week could lean toward bearish due to the more prominent lower wick lengths indicating stronger selling pressure. However, the relatively tight fight between buyers and sellers, as evidenced by the close average lengths of the upper and lower wicks, indicates potential for a shift in sentiment. It's also essential to take into account other market information and indicators for a more comprehensive analysis.
